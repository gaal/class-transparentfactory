Class-TransparentFactory

This module is intended for developers who find they need to refactor
code away from one provider of functionality to a factory + set of
API-compatible providers. It's not that factories are very difficult to
write or maintain, but code that uses them tends to be somewhat cluttered.

With Class-TransparentFactory, your user code remains exactly as it was
before you split off to several providers; the original module class
turns into a facade in which class methods are automatically turned into
proxies for the appropriate provider class.
